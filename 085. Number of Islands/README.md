# Solution(Python)

## DFS TC(O(MN)) SC(O(MN))

Iterate through each of the cell and if it is an island, do dfs to mark all adjacent islands, then increase the counter by 1.

## BFS TC(O(MN)) SC(O(MN))

Iterate through each of the cell and if it is an island, do bfs to mark all adjacent islands, then increase the counter by 1.
