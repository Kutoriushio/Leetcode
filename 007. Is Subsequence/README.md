# Solution(Python)

1. Define two pointers to point the start of two strings respectively.

2. Iterate over `t` one character.

3. If the element of `s` euqals to the element of `t`, the pointer of `s` moves one character.

4. In each iteration the pointer of `t` moves one chacracter.

5. Check if the length of `s` equals to number of pointer movements.
