# Solution(Python)

1. Use two pointers to point the `mth` of `nums1` and `nth` of `nums2` respectively, and initialize `index` to `m + n - 1`.

2. Compare the two numbers, put the bigger one in the `index` of `nums1`, and make this pointer move to left, then `index` minus 1.

3. Loop until pointer2 out of list.
